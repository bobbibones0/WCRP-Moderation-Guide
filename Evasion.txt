## When
When a player is being moderated and they run away, it is evasion. If they leave it is LTAP -> https://discord.com/channels/1248149425482895390/1250891707113803877

## Catching
* 1. You must have the username
* 2. :wanted them, :bring them and then cuff them.
* 3. If you got them, do the punishment they were getting normally. If you did not get them, continue.
* 4. :jail them, go :to them and talk to them in jail. If their jail time is over, just :jail again.
* 5. Execute the normal punishment (If they should be kicked, do not do it yet, just log it with the BOLO)
* 6. Go to Evasion.

### Evasion
* 1. Say: ```You will be kicked for Evasion, please do not rejoin for 1 hour. Do you understand?```
* 2. Log the punishment: ```:log punish 'playername' Kick Evasion```
* 3. Place a BOLO: ```:log punish 'playername' BOLO 1 hour kick, Evasion```
* 4. :kick them
