## When
For example, when someone points at someone and the other person takes their gun out too without any fear (officers might try to do this, but realistic). You must imagine it happening to you in real life and see if you would have fear, fear can be expressed in-game with text messages, slow walking and moving as little as possible

## Handling the Situation.
* 1. Ask/Get the username of the violator.
* 2. If mod call (so you did not see it happen), ask if they have a clip/video. If they do not, you cannot do anything. If they do, say this: ```Please create a player report ticket in our DS server, and send it there.```
* 3. Say that you will review the clip. If it is not valid say: ```Unfortunately, I cannot confirm that they have violated our rules, I am sorry. Please void this scene.``` If it is valid say: ```Thanks for reporting this, the player will be punished soon.```
* 4. Check their moderation history for Fear Roleplay with ERM Desktop.
* 5. :view them if they are not there, if they are in a car, :load them.
* 6. :bring and cuff them if they are not there.
* 7. If they have violated this rule 2 times before, go to Third Time. Otherwise go to Fear Roleplay.

### Fear Roleplay
* 1. Say: ```You will be warned for failing to use Fear Roleplay, please do not repeat this in the future```
* 2. Log the punishment: ```:log punish 'playername' Warning Fear Roleplay```


### Third Time
* 1. Say:  ```You will be kicked for repeatedly failing to use Fear Roleplay, please do not rejoin for 1 hour. Do you understand?```
* 2. Wait a second, do the next stuff as fast as possible.
* 3. Log the punishment: ```:log punish 'playername' Kick Third Fear Roleplay```
* 4. Place a BOLO: ```:log punish 'playername' BOLO 1 hour kick, Third Fear Roleplay```
* 5. :kick them
