## When
Respawning on death is when you get killed, and you click respawn. You are allowed to do this if there is not EMS (Fire Department) online or if they have been waiting for 5 minutes.

## Handling the Situation.
* 1. Ask/Get the username of the violator.
* 2. Check if they have been killed recently, if not say: ```They have not been killed recently, therefore I cannot confirm that they violated this rule, I am sorry``` If it has been more than 5 minutes, say: ```It has been more than 5 minutes, which means they are allowed respawn and enforce the New Life Rule.```
* 3. If there is no EMS online, say: ```There is no EMS online right now, which means they are allowed to respawn and enforce the New Life Rule.```
* 5. :view them and make sure they actually respawned (they are not with EMS for example).
* 4. Say: ```Thanks for reporting this, they will be punished soon.```
* 5. Check their moderation history for Respawning on Death with ERM Desktop.
* 6. :view them if they are not there, if they are in a car, :load them.
* 7. Go :to and cuff them if they are not there.
* 8. If they have violated this rule 2 times before, go to Third Time. Otherwise go to Respawning on Death.

### Respawning on Death
* 1. Say: ```You will be warned for Respawning on Death, please do not repeat this in the future.```
* 2. Log the punishment: ```:log punish 'playername' Warning Respawning on Death```

### Third Time
* 1. Say:  ```You will be kicked for repeatedly Respawning on Death, please do not rejoin for 1 hour. Do you understand?```
* 2. Wait a second, do the next stuff as fast as possible.
* 3. Log the punishment: ```:log punish 'playername' Kick Third Respawning on Death```
* 4. Place a BOLO: ```:log punish 'playername' BOLO 1 hour kick, Third Respawning on Death```
* 5. :kick them
