## When
VDM stands for Random vehicle death-match. It means you randomly shoot/break a vehicle, with for no reason. For example, you are just driving and someone shows up and randomly shoots your vehicle, that is VDM. It can be tricky to decide when it is VDM, when they are involved in the same situation, it is not VDM. Also, police shooting a car to make it stop, is VDM. They should use spikes or the grappler.

## Handling the Situation.
* 1. Ask/Get the username of the violator.
* 2. If mod call (so you did not see it happen), ask if they have a clip/video. If they do not, you cannot do anything. If they do, say this: ```Please create a player report ticket in our DS server, and send it there.```
* 5. Say that you will review the clip. If it is not valid say: ```Unfortunately, I cannot confirm that they have violated our rules, I am sorry. Please void this scene.``` If it is valid say: ```Thanks for reporting this, the player will be punished soon.```
* 6. Check their moderation history for VDM with ERM Desktop.
* 7. :view them if they are not there, if they are in a car, :load them.
* 8. :bring and cuff them if they are not there.
* 9. If more than 3 cars were shot and caught fire, go to Mass VDM. If they have violated this rule 2 times before, go to Third Time. Otherwise go to VDM.

### VDM
* 1. Say: ```You will be warned for VDM, please do not repeat this in the future.```
* 2. Log the punishment: ```:log punish 'playername' Warning VDM```

### Mass VDM

* 2. Wait a second, do the next stuff as fast as possible.
* 3. Log the punishment: ```:log punish 'playername' Kick Mass VDM```
* 4. Place a BOLO: ```:log punish 'playername' BOLO 1 hour kick, Mass VDM```
* 5. :kick them

### Third Time
* 1. Say:  ```You will be kicked for repeatedly preforming VDM, please do not rejoin for 1 hour. Do you understand?```
* 2. Wait a second, do the next stuff as fast as possible.
* 3. Log the punishment: ```:log punish 'playername' Kick Third VDM```
* 4. Place a BOLO: ```:log punish 'playername' BOLO 1 hour kick, Third VDM```
