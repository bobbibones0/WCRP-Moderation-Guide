## When
Auto jailing is when you cuff someone and click arrest. They get put in jail automatically. What they have to do is, detain them to put them in their car, drive them to jail, go inside and RP a bit, stand in front of a jail cel with them and then click arrest.

## Handling the Situation.
* 1. :unjail them.
* 2. Ask/Get the username of the violator.
* 3. If mod call (so you did not see it happen), ask if they have a clip/video. If they do not, you cannot do anything. If they do, say this: ```Please create a player report ticket in our DS server, and send it there.```
* 4. Say that you will review the clip. If it is not valid say: ```Unfortunately, I cannot confirm that they have violated our rules, I am sorry. Please void this scene.``` If it is valid say: ```Thanks for reporting this, the player will be punished soon.```
* 5. Check their moderation history for Auto Jailing with ERM Desktop.
* 6. :view them if they are not there, if they are in a car, :load them.
* 7. :bring and cuff them if they are not there.
* 8. If more then 3 players where auto jailed, go to Mass Auto Jailing. If they have violated this rule 2 times before, go to Third Time. Otherwise go to Auto Jailing.
