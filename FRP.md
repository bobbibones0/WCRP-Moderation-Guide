## When
If player does something unrealistic, it is FRP. For example, not doing crash RP (hitting something hard and just continuing to drive), not pulling back the spike strip within 5 seconds.


## Handling the Situation.
* 1. Ask/Get the username of the violator.
* 2. If mod call, check :killogs, ensure that they killed them.
* 3. If mod call (so you did not see it happen), ask if they have a clip/video. If they do not, you cannot do anything. If they do, say this: ```Please create a player report ticket in our DS server, and send it there.```
* 4. Say that you will review the clip. If it is not valid say: ```Unfortunately, I cannot confirm that they have violated our rules, I am sorry. Please void this scene.``` If it is valid say: ```Thanks for reporting this, the player will be punished soon.```
* 5. Check their moderation history for FRP with ERM Desktop.
* 6. :view them if they are not there, if they are in a car, :load them.
* 7. :bring and cuff them if they are not there.
* 8. If they have violated this rule 2 times before, go to Third Time. Otherwise go to FRP

### FRP
* 1. Say: ```You will be warned for FRP, please do not repeat this in the future.```
* 2. Log the punishment: ```:log punish 'playername' Warning FRP```

### Third Time
* 1. Say:  ```You will be kicked for repeatedly preforming FRP, please do not rejoin for 1 hour. Do you understand?```
* 2. Wait a second, do the next stuff as fast as possible.
* 3. Log the punishment: ```:log punish 'playername' Kick Third FRP```
* 4. Place a BOLO: ```:log punish 'playername' BOLO 1 hour kick, Third FRP```
* 5. :kick them
