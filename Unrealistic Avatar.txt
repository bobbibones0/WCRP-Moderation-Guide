## When
If a character includes items that you could not have on you in real life, or do not exist in real life.

## Handling the Situation.
* 1. Ask them to remove that item from their avatar.
* 2. :refresh them when they did it.
* 3. If they are in spawn, they might just joined. Give them enough time (even if they are not in spawn)
* 3. If they do not change it, go to Unrealistic Avatar

### Unrealistic Avatar
* 1. Say: ```You will be kicked for not changing your unrealistic avatar, please do not rejoin for 1 hour. Do you understand?```
* 2. Wait a second, do the next stuff as fast as possible.
* 3. Log the punishment: ```:log punish 'playername' Kick Not Changing Unrealistic Avatar```
* 4. Place a BOLO: ```:log punish 'playername' BOLO 1 hour kick, Not Changing Unrealistic Avatar```
* 5. :kick them
