## When
RDM stands for Random death-match. It means you randomly kill someone, with for no reason. For example, you are just walking and someone shows up and randomly kills you, that is RDM. It can be tricky to decide when it is RDM, when they are involved in the same situation, it is not RDM.

## Handling the Situation.
* 1. If it is a mod call, :heal the player.
* 2. Ask/Get the username of the violator.
* 3. If mod call, check :killogs, ensure that they killed them.
* 4. If mod call (so you did not see it happen), ask if they have a clip/video. If they do not, you cannot do anything. If they do, say this: ```Please create a player report ticket in our DS server, and send it there.```
* 5. Say that you will review the clip. If it is not valid say: ```Unfortunately, I cannot confirm that they have violated our rules, I am sorry. Please void this scene.``` If it is valid say: ```Thanks for reporting this, the player will be punished soon.```
* 6. Check their moderation history for RDM with ERM Desktop.
* 7. :view them if they are not there, if they are in a car, :load them.
* 8. :bring and cuff them if they are not there.
* 9. If more then 3 players where killed, go to Mass RDM. If they have violated this rule 2 times before, go to Third Time. Otherwise go to RDM.

### RDM
* 1. Say: ```You will be warned for RDM, please do not repeat this in the future.```
* 2. Log the punishment: ```:log punish 'playername' Warning RDM```

### Mass RDM
* 1. Say:  ```You will be kicked for Mass RDM, please do not rejoin for 1 hour. Do you understand?```
* 2. Wait a second, do the next stuff as fast as possible.
* 3. Log the punishment: ```:log punish 'playername' Kick Mass RDM```
* 4. Place a BOLO: ```:log punish 'playername' BOLO 1 hour kick, Mass RDM```
* 5. :kick them

### Third Time
* 1. Say:  ```You will be kicked for repeatedly preforming RDM, please do not rejoin for 1 hour. Do you understand?```
* 2. Wait a second, do the next stuff as fast as possible.
* 3. Log the punishment: ```:log punish 'playername' Kick Third RDM```
* 4. Place a BOLO: ```:log punish 'playername' BOLO 1 hour kick, Third RDM```
* 5. :kick them
